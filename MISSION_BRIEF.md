# MISSION BRIEF: AI Geospatial Analyst

## 1. Core Objective
To win the hackathon by creating a reasoning-enabled framework that combines a Large Language Model (LLM) with geoprocessing APIs to auto-generate and execute multi-step geospatial workflows from natural language queries.
## 2. Project Status & Progress
### Phase 0: Environment & Foundation (100% Complete)
- [x] Ollama installed and Mistral model pulled.
- [x] Python virtual environment (`venv`) created and activated.
- [x] All required Python libraries installed.
- [x] Secure `.gitignore` file created.
### Phase 1: The AI's "Toolbelt" (100% Complete)
- [x] Definitive `tools.py` file created.
- [x] Implemented a secure, robust `GeoSpatialContext` for state management.
- [x] Developed a comprehensive suite of tools for vector and raster analysis.
- [x] Integrated best-in-class security (validation, sanitization) and logging.
### Phase 2: The Agent & Core UI (90% Complete)
- [x] `app.py` created with initial Streamlit UI.
- [x] LangChain ReAct agent configured with the LLM and our custom tools.
- [x] Core chat functionality implemented.
- [ ] **Next Step:** Enhance the UI to visualize the "Chain of Thought" and the map output.
### Phase 3: The "Wow Factor" - Visualization & Interactivity (0% Complete)
- [ ] Implement map rendering with `streamlit-folium`.
- [ ] Display loaded and generated vector layers on the map.
- [ ] Show the AI's "Chain of Thought" log in a dedicated, user-friendly panel.
- [ ] (Optional Stretch Goal) Add graph plotting for statistical results.
### Phase 4: Demonstration & Pitch (0% Complete)
- [ ] Define and prepare data for benchmark tasks (e.g., Flood Risk, Site Selection).
- [ ] Refine the user workflow for a smooth 3-minute demo.
- [ ] Prepare the presentation and pitch.
## 3. Key Architectural Decisions
- **LLM:** Mistral 7B (via Ollama) for local, fast, and powerful reasoning.
- **Agent Framework:** LangChain ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) for its robust tool-calling loop.
- **UI:** Streamlit for rapid, interactive web app development.
- **GIS Engine:** GeoPandas (Vector), Rasterio (Raster).
- **Security Model:** A "sandboxed" approach where the LLM can only call pre-defined, validated, and sanitized Python functions from `tools.py`. No arbitrary code execution is permitted.
## 4. Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Launch the App:** Run `streamlit run app.py` to get the current version live.
2.  **Basic Test:** Perform a simple first-step command like `Load the file 'data/rivers.shp' as 'main_rivers'` to ensure the agent is thinking.
3.  **UI Enhancement:** Begin work on Phase 3 by integrating a `streamlit-folium` map into `app.py`.
